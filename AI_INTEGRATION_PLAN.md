# Email AI Integration Plan

## Overview
Enhance the email system with AI capabilities to provide intelligent email management, search, and categorization.

## Core Features

### 1. Vector Embeddings
- Convert all email content into vector embeddings
- Store vectors in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Enable semantic search capabilities across email content

### 2. Natural Language Queries
- Allow users to search emails using human language
- Example queries:
  - "What tasks do I still have left from work?"
  - "Show me emails from John about the project deadline"
  - "Find all receipts from last month"
  - "What's my next meeting?"

### 3. Automatic Categorization
- Automatically categorize emails into predefined categories:
  - Work
  - Personal
  - Finance
  - Travel
  - Shopping
  - Social
  - Subscriptions
  - Important
  - Follow-up needed

### 4. Smart Organization
- Implement intelligent sorting based on:   
  - Priority
  - Sender importance
  - Content relevance
  - Time sensitivity
  - User interaction patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Vector Database
- Use a dedicated vector database for storing embeddings
- Implement efficient indexing for fast retrieval
- Set up regular synchronization with email content

### AI Processing Pipeline
1. **Email Ingestion**: Capture new emails as they arrive
2. **Content Extraction**: Parse email content, headers, and metadata
3. **Vectorization**: Generate embeddings using language models
4. **Categorization**: Apply classification models to categorize emails
5. **Storage**: Save vectors and categories in the database
6. **Indexing**: Update search indices for quick retrieval

### User Interface
- Add a natural language search bar
- Create category-based email views
- Implement smart filters and sorting options
- Display AI-generated insights and summaries

## Benefits
- Reduced time spent organizing emails
- Improved information retrieval
- Better email management
- Personalized email experience
- Actionable insights from email content

## Next Steps
1. Research and select vector database solution
2. Develop email content extraction pipeline
3. Implement vector embedding generation
4. Create categorization models
5. Build search and query interface
6. Design and implement UI components
7. Test with real user data
8. Iterate based on feedback
